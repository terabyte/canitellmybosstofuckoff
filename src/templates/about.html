<h1>Life is all about goals</h1>
<p>
And for many people, the financial freedom to tell your boss where they can
shove it is the ultimate goal.  Unfortunately, a lot of people have a very
naive idea of what it takes to reach that financial freedom.  Many people
have performed the most rudimentry and obvious math: "I have $X, the
average annual return of my investments is Y%, I need $Z per year to live,
and X*Y is larger than Z, so FUCK OFF, BOSS!".
</p><p>
Unfortunately, there is a lot more to it.  The stock market returns 8%
<b>on average</b>, but in the last 100 years it has seen +55% years and
-55% years.  The standard deviation of the Dow Jones is about 19%.  For the
less mathematically inclined, what that means is the return of the Dow
Jones will be 8% plus or minus 19%, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Rules_for_normally_distributed_data">
    68% of the time</a>, if it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_performance#Mutual_Fund_Disclosures">
    continues to perform the same as it has the last 100 years</a>.  If
that sentence did not engender in you images of a confident retirement,
good, you understand what it means.
</p>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>
This calculation uses a statistical method called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo
Analysis</a>.  Monte Carlo Analysis involves running a simulation many times
and determining the likelihood of events by counting the results that actually
happen.  The simulation involves random variables so each run is different.  If
you use inputs and random variable distributions which accurately reflect
reality, you can get very accurate probabilities.  This method has been proven
very effective, for example, in estimating probability in games of chance,
because for those situations we have extremely good understanding of the
distribution of random events, and the inputs.  You could calculate the
probability of getting a royal flush in poker using closed, deterministic
equations, but if you didn't know how to do that, you could instead simply deal
hundreds of thousands of hands, count up how many royal flushes you see, and
the more simulations you run the closer you will get to the real answer.
</p><p>
Unlike a deck of cards, we never know what lies in store for the stock
market.  We can make informed guesses by looking not only at past values, but
at the distribution of past values.  Since the stock market is comprised of
many different independent events, it is reasonable to approximate it using a
normal distribution (thanks, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit
theorem</a>).  The simulation uses the inputs to simulate each year of your
retirement, earning a market return, removing an annual distribution, adjusting
everything for inflation, etc.  If at any point you run out of money, you fail
and die destitute.  If you reach your age of death with more than zero dollars,
you die happy and bequeath everything left to some combination of your
precocious progeny and society-benefiting charities, in a ratio that would make
<a href="https://givingpledge.org/Pledger.aspx?id=177>Warren Buffet</a> proud.
You have heard of his most famous quote about inheritance, right?  <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2018/06/01/warren-buffetts-advice-on-how-to-raise-well-adjusted-heirs/?sh=2b952ccc712f">"You
should leave your children enough so they can do anything, but not enough so
they can do nothing.‚Äù</a>
</p><p>
The entire simulation of your life, from the current year to your death, is
then rerun hundreds of thousands of times, and the results counted.  If the
simulation says you make it 95% of the time, you can be pretty confident you
will make it (especially if you make conservative choices in your inputs, like
erring on the high side for inflation, annual distribution, standard deviation,
and age of death, and on the low side for average return and social security
distributions).  If, however, the model thinks you run out of money more often
than not, you are going to want to keep working and delay retirement a few more
years.  That said, do not skip the very important disclaimer below.

The disclaimer at the top of the landing page is not just to
cover my own ass, I am <b>NOT</b> a professional financial advisor or investor

day I thought it'd be cute and funny to tell them to do this in a single snarky

encourage you to think about the many benefits of not dying destitute, and seek
professional help to ensure you do not.  <b><i>Use the calculations provided
